There are [many](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html) [tutorials](https://try.github.io/), uncluding as free half day course from [software carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)\n",

    "- Nothing commited to git is ever lost or overwritten and you can back it up/host it for free on sites like github and bitbucket\n",
    "- git frees you to experiment. You can make changes to dozens of files and undo/redo them all with a single command. No need to switch around files frantically hitting ctrl-z until things run again\n",
